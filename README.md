Khan Academy Learner Engagement Analysis
This project involves analyzing data related to student registrations and activity on the Khan Academy platform. The analysis was conducted using Python (Pandas) and Microsoft Excel.

Project Overview
The project focuses on the following key areas:

Student Registration by District: Analyzing the number of students registered on Khan Academy across various districts.
Monthly Student Activity: Identifying the total number of students who accessed the Khan Academy platform each month.
Learning Time Analysis: Inspecting the average learning time spent by active students on the platform each month.
Data and Tools
Data: The dataset used for this project contains information on student registrations and activity on the Khan Academy platform, segmented by district and month.
Tools:
Python (Pandas): For data cleaning, manipulation, and initial analysis.
Microsoft Excel: For data visualization and further analysis.
Analysis Summary
1. Student Registration by District
Finding: Districts 6 and 8 had the highest number of student registrations on Khan Academy.
Recommendation: Focus efforts on districts with lower registrations, such as Districts 10 and 5, to increase their engagement.
2. Monthly Student Activity
Finding: The highest student activity was recorded in April and May, with a noticeable decline after May. The lowest activity was observed in November and December.
Recommendation: Investigate the reasons for the decline in student activity post-May and implement strategies to sustain engagement throughout the year.
3. Learning Time Analysis
Finding: The average learning time spent on the platform was highest in April, followed by a continuous decline in subsequent months.
Recommendation: Consider introducing new features or incentives in later months to maintain student interest and learning time on the platform.
Personal Insights and Recommendations
Students tend to be most active at the beginning of the academic session (April), likely due to excitement about new classes.
Regular feedback from students and parents could help identify areas for improvement in the learning experience.
Teacher training on innovative methods and periodic performance assessments could enhance teaching effectiveness.
Continuous assessment and improvement of the Khan Academy platform are recommended to maintain student engagement.
Conclusion
This project provides insights into student behavior on the Khan Academy platform, offering recommendations for increasing registration and engagement across various districts and months. The combination of Python and Excel proved effective in analyzing and visualizing the data.
